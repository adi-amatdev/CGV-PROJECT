Project: Projectile Motion Simulation

Description:
The "Projectile Motion Simulation" project aims to provide a visual
representation of projectile motion. It demonstrates the basic formulas, 
theories, and ideas behind displaying a cannonball in motion. With this 
simulation, users can interactively adjust the cannon's angle using the 
mouse and increase or decrease the power using arrow keys. The cannonball 
is launched by pressing the space bar. The simulation also traces the path 
of the projectile.

This project was developed as part of our college coursework and serves as a practical
implementation of the concepts learned in physics and computer graphics. It provides 
an engaging way to understand the principles of projectile motion.

We hope you find this simulation informative and enjoyable!
